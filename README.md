# Dungeons_and_Dragons: The Hunt
## Description
This is an unofficial videogame based on the famous tabletop role-playing game "Dungeons and Dragons", created for academic purposes. The main reason behind this project was to implement simple AI (Knowledge-based agent and Bayesian probabilistic agent) ingame.

## Objective
This game was inspired by the Wumpus World game, famous example to illustrate knowledge representation in AI. By default, there are 3 demon portals, 1 village and 1 werewolf. The latter is the player's main objective to kill before returning to the village. If the player is killed or returns to the village before killing the werewolf he loses. The trick behind this game is that the night has fallen and it has gotten very dark, so the player must really on his senses to complete his task.

## How to run it:
Run the file "main.py" inside the "src" directory.
